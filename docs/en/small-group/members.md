From this page, you can add, edit, and delete the e-mail addresses for your group.

## Add a New Group Member

To add an e-mail address, click the icon or text in the center of the page, below the title and above the list of addresses for your group.

## Edit Group Member

To edit an e-mail address, click the pencil icon; it's the first icon under the “Actions” column heading. This will allow you to update the name and/or the e-mail address for that member.

## Delete a Group Member

To delete an e-mail address, click the trash can icon in the “Actions” column. Note that once an e-mail address has been deleted, it is gone. (Of course, if you delete it in error, you can enter it again using the “Add” instructions above.)
