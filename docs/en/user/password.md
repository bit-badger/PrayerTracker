title: Change Your Password
---

This page will let you change your password. Enter your existing password in the top box, then enter your new password in the bottom two boxes. Entering your existing password is a security measure; with the “Remember Me” box on the log in page, this will prevent someone else who may be using your computer from being able to simply go to the site and change your password.

"If you cannot remember your existing password, we cannot retrieve it, but we can set it to something known so that you can then change it to your password. [Click here to request help resetting your password](mailto:daniel@bitbadger.solutions?subject=PrayerTracker%20Password%20Help).
