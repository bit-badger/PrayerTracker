Throughout PrayerTracker, you'll see an icon (a question mark in a circle) next to the title on each page. Clicking this will open a new, small window with directions on using that page. If you are looking for a quick overview of PrayerTracker, start with the “Add / Edit a Request” and “Change Preferences” entries.
